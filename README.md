> Self-identifying base encodings

Multibase is a protocol for disambiguating the "base encoding" used to express
binary data in text formats (e.g., base32, base36, base64, base58, etc.) from the
expression alone.

When text is encoded as bytes, we can usually use a one-size-fits-all encoding
(UTF-8) because we're always encoding to the same set of 256 bytes (+/- the NUL
byte). When that doesn't work, usually for historical or performance reasons, we
can usually infer the encoding from the context.

However, when bytes are encoded as text (using a base encoding), the choice of
base encoding (and alphabet, and other factors) is often restricted by the
context. Worse, these restrictions can change based on where the data appears in
the text. In some cases, we can only use `[a-z0-9]`. In others, we can use a
larger set of characters but need a compact encoding. This has lead to a large
set of "base encodings", almost one for every use-case. Unlike the case of
encoding text to bytes, it is impractical to standardize widely around a single
base encoding because there is no optimal encoding for all cases.

As data travels beyond its context, it becomes quite hard to ascertain *which*
base encoding of the many possible ones were used; that's where multibase comes
in. Where the data has been prefixed before leaving its context behind, it
answers the question:

> Given binary data `d` encoded into text `s`, what base `b` was used to encode it?

To answer this question, a single code point is prepended to `s` at time of
encoding, which signals in that new context which `b` can be used to reconstruct
`d`.

**NOTE:** Multibase-prefixes are encoding agnostic and their canonical form is a Unicode [code point], not an ASCII character or corresponding UTF-8 bytes.  Since UTF-8 is the most common context for binary data that gets prefixed as a multibase today, the UTF-8 column is provided as a reference for detecting multibase-prefixes, since most of these codes can be detected in the first byte. 

However, if the string in question came from a UTF-32 context, detecting and dropping an initial byte of `0x7a` would not suffice to confirm the rest was `base58btc`-encoded bytes; `[0x7a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]` would instead be the UTF-32 bytes that correspond to the `z` of that code to be detected and dropped.

## Reserved

The following codes are _reserved_ for (backwards) compatibility with existing systems and cannot be registered in the `multibase` table. Note that all three Unicode entries here correspond to entries in the UTF-8-keyed [multiformats] registry group registered under their UTF-8 equivalents.

* `/` (U+002F) - Separator used by [multiaddr].
* `1` (U+0031) - Base58-encoded identity multihashes used by libp2p peer IDs.
* `Q` (U+0011) - Base58-encoded sha2-256 multihashes used by libp2p/ipfs for peer IDs and CIDv0.

If you'd like to switch a project over to multibase and would also like to
reserve a prefix for compatibility, please file an issue in this repository.

## Status

Each multibase encoding has a status:

* draft - these encodings have been proposed but are not widely implemented and may be removed.
* candidate - these encodings are mature and widely implemented but may not be implemented by all implementations.
* default - these encodings should be implemented by all implementations and are widely used.

## Multibase By Example

Consider the following encodings of the same binary string:

```
4D756C74696261736520697320617765736F6D6521205C6F2F # base16 (hex)
JV2WY5DJMJQXGZJANFZSAYLXMVZW63LFEEQFY3ZP           # base32
3IY8QKL64VUGCX009XWUHKF6GBBTS3TVRXFRA5R            # base36
YAjKoNbau5KiqmHPmSxYCvn66dA1vLmwbt                 # base58
TXVsdGliYXNlIGlzIGF3ZXNvbWUhIFxvLw==               # base64
```

And consider the same encodings with their multibase prefix

```
F4D756C74696261736520697320617765736F6D6521205C6F2F # base16 F
BJV2WY5DJMJQXGZJANFZSAYLXMVZW63LFEEQFY3ZP           # base32 B
K3IY8QKL64VUGCX009XWUHKF6GBBTS3TVRXFRA5R            # base36 K
zYAjKoNbau5KiqmHPmSxYCvn66dA1vLmwbt                 # base58 z
MTXVsdGliYXNlIGlzIGF3ZXNvbWUhIFxvLw==               # base64 M
```

The base prefixes used are: `F, B, K, z, M`.


## FAQ

> Is this a real problem?

Yes. If i give you `"1214314321432165"` is that decimal? or hex? or something else? See also:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_clean
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8571501/how-to-check-whether-the-string-is-base64-encoded-or-not

> Why the strange selection of codes / characters?

The code values are selected such that they are included in the alphabets of the
base they represent. For example, `f` is the base code for `base16 (hex)`,
because `f` is in hex's 16 character alphabet. Note that most of the alphabets
used can be encoded in UTF-8, and most but not all can be encoded in ASCII. We
have yet not found a case needing something else.

> Don't we have to agree on a table of base encodings?

Yes, but we already have to agree on base encodings, so this is not hard. The table even leaves some room for custom encodings.
